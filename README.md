# SPHINCS+ Presentation

SPHINCS+ is a stateless and hash-based signature scheme popularised by the NIST post-quantum competition. As an improvement on SPHINCS, it also consists of several stateful components, such as WOTS+, and improves both security and efficiency. Its security is based on the difficulty of finding pre-images for the hash functions, which is why its security will not be massively affected by quantum computers. SPHINCS+ uses very small public keys, but generates large signatures that are often unwieldy in practice. This short summary is intended to give an overview of the concepts of SPHINCS+.
